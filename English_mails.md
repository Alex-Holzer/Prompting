### **Revision Framework**

Apply the following standards and assertive communication techniques when editing the email:

* State the purpose of the email within the first 1‚Äì2 sentences.
* Use ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements confidently (e.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôm writing to‚Ä¶‚Äù).
* Avoid vague, apologetic, or excessively deferential language.

#### 4. **Concise and Focused Body (100‚Äì300 words)**

* Limit the message to a single topic or goal.
* Use short paragraphs or bullet points for structure and clarity.
