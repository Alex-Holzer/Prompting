# 🚀 Advanced Guide for Crafting Programming Prompts (State-of-the-Art Techniques)

This guide leverages cutting-edge prompt engineering practices optimized for GPT-4 and newer reasoning models (such as O1), ensuring your prompts lead to accurate, efficient, secure, and maintainable solutions.

---

## 🔖 Step 1: Define a Clear and Specific Instruction

Explicitly state your task objective in precise terms.

- **Enhanced Example:**  
  > *"Write a Python 3.11 function named `filter_even_sum` that accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of even integers only."*

---

## 📑 Step 2: Provide Comprehensive Context

Include relevant technical details that clearly frame your prompt.

- **Include:**
  - Programming language version
  - Frameworks, libraries, or APIs (use or avoid)
  - Execution environment (local IDE, Databricks, cloud)

- **Advanced Example:**  
  > *"Using PySpark in a Databricks notebook, create a function that aggregates user events stored in a Delta table named 'user_events', grouping by user ID."*

---

## 🧮 Step 3: Structured Task Decomposition (Chain-of-Thought)

Encourage explicit step-by-step reasoning to boost accuracy.

- **Technique:** Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT)  
  Prompt explicitly for intermediate reasoning steps, pseudo-code, or structured problem breakdown.

- **Example Prompt:**
  > *"Approach this problem step by step: First, outline a plan or pseudocode. Then, implement the function based on this plan."*

---

## 📌 Step 4: Provide Few-shot Examples (When Applicable)

Use brief examples to clearly illustrate desired output patterns.

- **Example:**  
```python
# Example Input:
[3, 4, 7, 10, 15]

# Example Output:
14  # Explanation: 4 + 10
```

---

## ⚠️ Step 5: Specify Edge Cases and Constraints Clearly

Explicitly guide the model to anticipate and handle potential pitfalls.

- **Common Constraints:**
  - Input size and scalability
  - Handling empty or invalid inputs
  - Performance complexity (Big O notation)
  - Memory management

- **Example:**
  > *"Your function must handle empty lists gracefully by returning `0`. The solution must scale linearly (O(n)) and avoid recursion."*

---

## 🎭 Step 6: Set the Role and Tone (Role Prompting)

Use roles to shape the style and depth of the response.

- **Role Examples:**
  - "Act as a senior Python developer reviewing code."
  - "You are a data scientist mentoring a junior colleague."

- **Advanced Prompt:**
  > *"Act as an experienced software engineer specializing in PySpark. Write code with clear explanatory inline comments."*

---

## 🧹 Step 7: Prompt for Maintainable, Efficient, and Secure Code

Explicitly instruct the model to adhere to best practices.

- **Include explicitly:**
  - Coding style (e.g., PEP 8)
  - Security (e.g., avoiding SQL injections, validating inputs)
  - Efficiency (complexity constraints, memory optimization)

- **Advanced Example:**
  > *"Write the function following PEP 8 style guidelines, include error handling, and optimize for memory and execution efficiency."*

---

## 🛠️ Step 8: Iterative Self-Improvement (Recursive Criticism and Improvement - RCI)

Encourage the model to critique its output and self-optimize.

- **RCI Prompt Example:**
  > *"Generate the code. Afterward, review your code for efficiency, maintainability, and security issues, then provide a revised and improved version."*

---

## 🔍 Step 9: Prompt Evaluation and Testing (Test-Driven Prompting)

Incorporate tests or checks to validate outputs proactively.

- **Testing Example Prompt:**
  > *"Implement the function. Then include three test cases demonstrating typical, boundary, and empty inputs. Confirm your implementation passes all tests."*

- **Explicit Testing Prompt:**
```python
# Tests your function must pass:
assert filter_even_sum([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 6
assert filter_even_sum([]) == 0
assert filter_even_sum([1, 3, 5]) == 0
```

---

## 📚 Step 10: Explicitly Request Documentation and Explanations

Prompt clearly for documentation, docstrings, and inline comments.

- **Example Prompt:**
  > *"Include a Pythonic docstring that briefly explains the purpose, parameters, return values, and an example usage."*

---

## 🔁 Step 11: Evaluate Prompt Effectiveness (Continuous Improvement)

Evaluate the success of your prompts based on:

- Code correctness and unit test pass rates
- Readability, maintainability, and efficiency of the generated code
- Feedback and revisions required (measure iterations)

- **Practical Tip:** Maintain a prompt registry or iterative log, tweaking prompts based on outcomes and edge-case performances.

Following this enhanced guide ensures your prompts maximize the potential of advanced language models, leading to high-quality, reliable outputs suitable for professional-grade software development and data science tasks.


Here’s a more structured, deeply expanded “perfect prompt” guide—reorganized into four phases and enriched with extra techniques, patterns, templates and anti‑patterns to help you squeeze every drop of performance from today’s most powerful LLMs.

---

## 📈 Phase 0: Preparation & Strategy

Before you even write a word of prompt, invest a few minutes to set yourself up for success:

1. **Clarify Your Goal**  
   - ✏️ *What exactly do you want?* (code, explanation, refactor, design doc...)  
   - 🎯 *Why are you doing it?* (learning, production, debugging, prototyping)

2. **Gather & Sanitize Context**  
   - ✅ Only include what’s strictly necessary.  
   - 📂 If you have long docs or codebases, break them into bite‑sized chunks or use a retrieval layer.  

3. **Define Constraints & Success Criteria**  
   - 🚦 Performance (Big O, memory)  
   - 🔒 Security (input validation, safe APIs)  
   - 📐 Style (PEP 8, company style guide)  
   - ✅ How will you verify? Unit tests? Peer review?  

---

## 🛠 Phase 1: Core Prompt Design

### 1.1. Explicit Instruction & Scope  
- **“Tell me to…” vs. “Write code that…”**  
- **Scope your ask**: one function / one class / one module.  

> **Bad:** “Solve binary tree problems.”  
> **Good:** “Implement a Python 3.11 class `BinarySearchTree` with insert, delete, and traversal methods.”

### 1.2. Role‑Based Framing  
- System & Role Messages (GPT‑4 style):  
  ``` 
  System: “You are a senior Python engineer.”  
  User:   “...”  
  ```  
- Persona injection: “As a data‑engineering mentor, explain….”

### 1.3. Environment & Dependencies  
- **Language** + **Version**: Python 3.11, Node 18, Scala 2.13  
- **Libraries / Frameworks**: Pandas, FastAPI, TensorFlow 2.x  
- **Execution context**: Azure Function, AWS Lambda, local Jupyter  

### 1.4. Input / Output Contract  
- **Schema**: JSON, CSV, plain text, Markdown, mermaid.js  
- **Formats**: “Return only valid JSON.”  
- **Strict parsability**: wrap code in markdown code fences, use tag markers.

---

## 🔄 Phase 2: Reasoning Patterns & Creativity Control

### 2.1. Chain‑of‑Thought Variants  
- **SCoT (Structured)**: “1. Pseudocode 2. Implementation 3. Tests”  
- **Scratchpad**: “Let me think step by step…”  
- **Reflection**: “After coding, evaluate time & space complexities.”

### 2.2. Temperature / Max Tokens / Top‑p  
- For **deterministic code**: Temperature = 0.0  
- For **creative brainstorming**: Temperature ≥ 0.7  
- Control output length if you need summaries.

### 2.3. Few‑Shot & One‑Shot Examples  
- **Positive example**: shows ideal answer  
- **Negative example**: shows common pitfall to avoid  

```text
Example 1: Good
Input: [2, 3, 4]
Output: 6

Example 2: Bad
Input: [2, 3, 4]
Output: 2, 4  # (we want sum, not list)
```

### 2.4. Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- If relying on large specs or docs, embed + retrieve relevant passages  
- Prompt: “Using the following excerpt from the Pandas docs, show how to pivot…”

---

## 🧪 Phase 3: Quality, Testing & Self‑Critique

### 3.1. Edge‑Case Enumeration  
- **Empty** / **Null** / **Large** / **Unsupported** inputs  
- **Performance bounds**: N up to 10⁶?  

### 3.2. Security & Validation  
- “Validate user input to prevent SQL injection.”  
- “Use parameterized queries.”

### 3.3. Automated Tests in Prompt  
- Ask for unit tests with `pytest` or `unittest`.  
- Provide assertions and test harness.

### 3.4. RCI (Recursive Criticism & Improvement)  
1. **Generate code**  
2. **Self‑review**: “Spot inefficiencies, refactor.”  
3. **Refine**: “Produce a final, improved version.”

> **Prompt snippet:**  
> “Step 1: Write code. Step 2: List 3 potential improvements. Step 3: Provide revised code.”

---

## 📊 Phase 4: Evaluation & Iteration

### 4.1. Measure Success  
- **Functional correctness**: All tests pass.  
- **Code quality**: Lint score, cyclomatic complexity.  
- **Performance**: Benchmarks.  

### 4.2. Store & Reuse  
- Maintain a **Prompt Registry** with versions, notes, and outcomes.  
- Reuse high‑performing templates.

### 4.3. Anti‑Patterns to Avoid  
| Anti‑Pattern                    | Why It Fails                              |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Vague requests (“Do something”) | Leads to unfocused, incorrect output     |
| Overloading context            | Exceeds token limit, confuses the model   |
| No success criteria            | Impossible to evaluate output             |
| High temperature for code      | Generates unpredictable, buggy code       |
